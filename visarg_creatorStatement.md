# Creator's Statement:
## Introduction and Reflection
### Introduction
The goal of this visual argument is to address the electric resource consumption that AI chatbots like ChatGPT require. My argument is essentially a quippy one-liner: "AI is the ultimate electricity hog". To effectively convey my message, I am using visual punning to liken AI to a "hog" because of how much electricity it uses in a day, as much as 33,000 households do [(Propublica)](www.propublica.org/article/data-centers-power-usage-washington-virginia). This is meant to reach an audience that may use popular AI platforms on a daily basis or just a few times a week with bots like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Google's Gemini. I want to inform an audience that may not have any idea that ChatGPT uses so much energy. The cultural context in which this issue arises is AI's increased popularity as an educational tool but also as a searching function that people prefer to use over traditional search engines nowadays. People may not even know that ChatGPT's electricity use is an issue because of how new it is to society at large. Additionally, this electricity consumption points to a larger issue because as much as simple queries demand electricity use, the expansion of AI also demands more funding and resource allocation towards large data centers. Companies like Google and Microsoft are increasingly contributing to greenhouse gas emissions because of their commitment to building and optimizing AI, and I want to highlight that the use of generative AI is not worth the environmental impact. The viewing context of this visual argument could be varied â€“ it could potentially be displayed as a flyer or as a post on the internet that prompts the viewer to do their own personal research on the subject. This influences my design decisions because I need to make the statistics or any text I choose to include short and memorable. 

### Reflection
Considering the rhetorical factors from the introduction, I focused on 6 design concepts: visual punning, empty space, density,proximity, point of focus, and alignment.

#### Visual Punning
My design and main tagline used visual punning as the main rhetorical argument. I likened AI to an electricity hog, which followed the statement the viewer reads first on the image "One year of electricity for 33,000 households = One day of electricity for ChatGPT". I wanted to play on the meaning of hog, which is to take up a lot of something. Visually, I displayed ChatGPT as two hogs by pasting the search bar of ChatGPT on images of hogs. I wanted to convey that as people search on ChatGPT, they are inadverdently hogging tons of electricity, enough to power thousands of households in a year. This was meant to further shock the audience- first with the surprising statistic, then with visual punning to show how greedy AI is in terms of its electricity usage. 

#### Empty Space
The first major change I made was that I decided to go against Reynolds' suggestion of empty space and minimalism. Originally, I had put a hog against a white background and a stat in a very simple font in order to increase the shock factor and avoid degrading my message with unnecessary noise. But, this was not very visually attractive to me. Instead, I opted for an added background of a data center, which I do not expect my audience to recognize, but gave my image a more techy, industrial look to it. This filled the entire image so there was no white space, leading me to my next design concept.

#### Density
Once I went against minimalism, there was no going back. My visual argument is an eyeful, and I did this purposefully. The data center as the background along with the size of the main AI "hog" contributed to the visual density of the design. I had three total images in the design and four elements, counting the text. I wanted the image to have these elements because they all speak in dialogue with each other. The message that the AI "hogs" rely on the data centers and electricity to work is aptly conveyed because I place the hogs, chatGPT search bars, and statistic against the "context" of the data center.

However, adding more elements backfired when I added images that alluded to electricity. I added a plug and some electric blue lines, and I tried to tie the statistic font color to the blue of electric lines. This added way too much noise and made my image quite messy and unpleasing to the eye. I ultimately removed these elements and simplified- making the font all white again and choosing a different, more readable one for the statistic, and ridding the plug and blue electricity entirely. I followed the Signal-to-Noise Ratio suggestions for these particular elements because I felt the electricity consumption point did not need to be emphasized even more with these unnecessary elements. 

Electricity imagery: Yikes, too much!

#### Proximity, Point of Focus, Alignment
Proximity played an important role in deciding where to put the chatGPT hogs on the image. I placed the main hog so that it took up the entire right side of the image, with its snout in the foreground, which draws the reader's eye to the tagline- AI is the ultimate electricity hog. I grouped it with a smaller hog (which showed the hog in its entirety) in order to make it clear that each query "hogs" electricity. I wanted to link these ideas even further by doing this, following peer feedback that the larger hog was not very clear in what it was at first glance. The larger hog is the point of focus in the image, and the eye naturally focuses on it first. Once the viewer sees that the chatGPT search bar is obscuring the face of the hog, they will relate these two (the hog and AI) together. Then, the eye is drawn to the statistic, the smaller hog, and the tagline.

I tweaked the placement of the two text fields in the image many times throughout the process, but ultimately landed on the final placements when I considered where the viewer's eye would be drawn to after taking each point in. I used the design concept of Alignment heavily to make sure that the elements contributed to this logical flow and highlight important features of the image. The larger ChatGPT hog is placed in alignment with the smaller one to make sure the viewer understands my visual pun and can make out the images of both hogs clearly. Then, the statistic is right above the smaller hog, which prompts the viewer to look at the next text field in the image. The main tagline is at the bottom and center, which is the last thing they may focus on after viewing the previous elements in the image. This is the ultimate conclusion and takeaway they should gain from the visual argument, after seeing the supporting evidence and punning at play to get to this argument. 

Final-ish
