The goal of this visual argument is to address the electric resource consumption that AI chatbots like ChatGPT require. I am primarily relying on a statistic from an [NPR article]([url](https://www.npr.org/2024/07/10/nx-s1-5028558/artificial-intelligences-thirst-for-electricity)) as support for the one-liner: "AI is the ultimate electricity hog". The stat is: “One query to ChatGPT uses approximately as much electricity as could light one lightbulb for about 20 minutes.” I am using visual punning to liken AI to a "hog" because of how much electricity just one search takes. This is meant to provoke an audience that may use AI on a daily basis with bots like ChatGPT from OpenAI or Google's Gemini. This points to a larger issue because as much as simple searches demand electricity use, it also demands more funding and resource allocation towards large data centers. Companies like Google and Microsoft are increasingly contributing to greenhouse gas emissions because of their commitment to building and optimizing AI, and I want to highlight that the use of generative AI is not worth the impact on our resources and environment.
