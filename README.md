The goal of this visual argument is to address the electric resource consumption that AI chatbots like ChatGPT require. My argument is essentially a quippy one-liner: "AI is the ultimate electricity hog". The statistic I am relying on highlights how AI chatbots like ChatGPT excessively use electricity. To effectively convey my message, I am using visual punning to liken AI to a "hog" because of how much electricity it uses in a day, as much as 33,000 households do (Propublica)[www.propublica.org/article/data-centers-power-usage-washington-virginia]. This is meant to reach an audience that may use AI on a daily basis or just a few times a week with bots like ChatGPT from OpenAI or Google's Gemini. I want to inform an audience that may not have any idea that ChatGPT uses so much energy. Additionally, this electricity consumption points to a larger issue because as much as simple queries demand electricity use, the expansion of AI also demands more funding and resource allocation towards large data centers. Companies like Google and Microsoft are increasingly contributing to greenhouse gas emissions because of their commitment to building and optimizing AI, and I want to highlight that the use of generative AI is not worth the environmental impact.
